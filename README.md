# Digit Recognizer

This is my very first neural network I designed on my own after I've completed several ML, TensorFlow and Python courses. I was tempted to go with the easiest approach and use a network with only fully connected Dense layers. The training images seemed to be very clear and easy to uplift by such architecture. However, I eventually decided to use more sophisticated units to try out what I had learnt so far. The network is built up from 2 blocks of Conv2D layers with MaxPool2Ds and Dropouts followed by a classifier block with 10 outputs and SoftMax as activation function. Classic architecture for those kinds of problems worked very well for me giving high accuracy of 0.9921.
